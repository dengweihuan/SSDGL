## Overview
```
Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classiﬁcation and have achieved great
success. However, the deep neural network model has a large parameter space and requires a large number of labeled data.
Deep learning methods for HSI classification usually follow a patchwise learning framework. Recently, a fast patch-free 
global learning (FPGA) architecture was proposed for HSI classification according to global spatial context information. 
However, FPGA has difficulty extracting the most discriminative features when the sample data is imbalanced. In this paper, 
a spectral-spatial dependent global learning (SSDGL) framework based on global convolutional long short-term memory (GCL) 
and global joint attention mechanism (GJAM) is proposed for insufficient and imbalanced HSI classification. In SSDGL, the 
hierarchically balanced (H-B) sampling strategy and the weighted softmax loss are proposed to address the imbalanced sample 
problem. To effectively distinguish similar spectral characteristics of land cover types, the GCL module is introduced to 
extract the long short-term dependency of spectral features. To learn the most discriminative feature representations, the 
GJAM module is proposed to extract attention areas. The experimental results obtained with three public HSI datasets show 
that the SSDGL has powerful performance in insufficient and imbalanced sample problems and is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.
